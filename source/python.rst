About Python
============

Below is a tutorial with the basics of Python you need to know to use oTree.

The easiest way to run this file is in IDLE (which is usually bundled in the Python installation).

There are many other good python tutorials online,
but note that some of the material covered in those tutorials
is not necessary for oTree programming specifically.
