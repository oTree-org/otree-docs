.. _currency:

Currency
========

In many experiments, participants play for currency:
either real money, or points. oTree supports both;
you can switch from points to real money by setting ``USE_POINTS = False``
in your settings.

You can write ``cu(42)`` to represent "42 currency units".
It works just like a number
(e.g. ``cu(0.1) + cu(0.2) == cu(0.3)``).
The advantage is that when it's displayed to users, it will automatically
be formatted as ``$0.30`` or ``0,30 â‚¬``, etc., depending on your
``REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_CODE`` and ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` settings.

.. note::

    ``cu()`` is new in oTree 5. Previously, ``c()`` was used to denote currencies.
    Code that already uses ``c()`` will continue to work.
    More info `here <https://groups.google.com/g/otree/c/Bwv67asPIlo>`__.

Use ``CurrencyField`` to store currencies in the database.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class Player(BasePlayer):
        random_bonus = models.CurrencyField()

To make a list of currency amounts, use ``currency_range``:

.. code-block:: python

    currency_range(0, 0.10, 0.02)
    # this gives:
    # [$0.00, $0.02, $0.04, $0.06, $0.08, $0.10]

In templates, instead of using the ``cu()`` function, you should use the
``|cu`` filter.
For example, ``{{ 20|cu }}`` displays as ``20 points``.


.. _payoff:

payoffs
-------

Each player has a ``payoff`` field.
If your player makes money, you should store it in this field.
``participant.payoff`` automatically stores the sum of payoffs
from all subsessions. You can modify ``participant.payoff`` directly,
e.g. to round the final payoff to a whole number.

At the end of the experiment, a participant's
total profit can be accessed by ``participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee()``;
it is calculated by converting ``participant.payoff`` to real-world currency
(if ``USE_POINTS`` is ``True``), and then adding
``session.config['participation_fee']``.

.. _points:

Points (i.e. "experimental currency")
-------------------------------------

If you set ``USE_POINTS = True``, then currency amounts will be points instead of dollars/euros/etc.
For example, ``cu(10)`` is displayed as ``10 points`` (or ``10 puntos``, etc.)

You can decide the conversion rate to real money
by adding a ``real_world_currency_per_point`` entry to your session config.

Converting points to real world currency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can convert a points amount to money using the method
``.to_real_world_currency``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    cu(10).to_real_world_currency(session)

(The ``session`` is necessary because
different sessions can have different conversion rates).

Decimal places
--------------

Money amounts are displayed with 2 decimal places.

On the other hand, points are integers.
This means amounts will get rounded to whole numbers,
like ``10`` divided by ``3`` is ``3``.
So, we recommend using point magnitudes high enough that you don't care about rounding error.
For example, set the endowment of a game to 1000 points, rather than 100.
