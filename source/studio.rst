oTree Studio
============

`oTree Studio <https://www.otreehub.com/studio>`__
is a point-and-click interface for building oTree apps.
It is free to use for small/medium sized projects.

We recommend using oTree Studio instead of a text editor (like PyCharm),
because it makes learning oTree much easier and
prevents many common mistakes.

Here are some `YouTube videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9BIa4PqQJt1bjXoe7ffPg/videos>`__ about oTree Studio.
