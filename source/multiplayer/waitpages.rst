.. _wait_pages:

Wait pages
==========

Wait pages are necessary when one player needs to wait for
others to take some action before they can proceed. For example,
in an ultimatum game, player 2 cannot accept or reject before they have
seen player 1's offer.

If you have a ``WaitPage`` in your sequence of pages,
then oTree waits until all players in the group have
arrived at that point in the sequence, and then all players are allowed
to proceed.

If your subsession has multiple groups playing simultaneously, and you
would like a wait page that waits for all groups (i.e. all players in
the subsession), you can set the attribute
``wait_for_all_groups = True`` on the wait page.

For more information on groups, see :ref:`groups`.

.. _after_all_players_arrive:

after_all_players_arrive
------------------------

``after_all_players_arrive`` lets you run some calculations
once all players have arrived at the wait
page. This is a good place to set the players' payoffs
or determine the winner.
You should first define a Group function that does the desired calculations.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_payoffs(group):
        for p in group.get_players():
            p.payoff = 100

Then trigger this function by doing:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyWaitPage(WaitPage):
        after_all_players_arrive = set_payoffs

If you set ``wait_for_all_groups = True``,
then ``after_all_players_arrive`` must be a *Subsession* function.

If you are using a text editor, ``after_all_players_arrive`` can also be defined directly in the WaitPage:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyWaitPage(WaitPage):
        @staticmethod
        def after_all_players_arrive(group: Group):
            for p in group.get_players():
                p.payoff = 100

It can also be a string:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyWaitPage(WaitPage):
        after_all_players_arrive = 'set_payoffs'


is_displayed()
--------------

Works the same way as with regular pages.

.. _group_by_arrival_time:

group_by_arrival_time
---------------------

If you set ``group_by_arrival_time = True`` on a WaitPage,
players will be grouped in the order they arrive at that wait page:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyWaitPage(WaitPage):
        group_by_arrival_time = True

For example, if ``PLAYERS_PER_GROUP = 2``, the first 2 players to arrive
at the wait page will be grouped together, then the next 2 players, and so on.

This is useful in sessions where some participants
might drop out (e.g. online experiments,
or experiments with consent pages that let the participant quit early), or
sessions where some participants take much longer than others.

A typical way to use ``group_by_arrival_time`` is to put it after an app
that filters out participants. For example, if your session has a consent page
that gives participants the chance to opt out of the study, you can make a "consent" app
that just contains the consent pages, and
then have an ``app_sequence`` like ``['consent', 'my_game']``,
where ``my_game`` uses ``group_by_arrival_time``.
This means that if someone opts out in ``consent``,
they will be excluded from the grouping in ``my_game``.

Presence detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    In :ref:`v60`, this behavior has changed.
    If a participant has not shown any signs of activity within a certain period of time,
    they are asked if they are still there.
    If they don't respond quickly enough, 
    they are sent to an "inactive" page and need to click a button to rejoin.

oTree detects and excludes participants who switched away to another tab or window.
In order to be grouped, a user must be active on the wait page.
There is a colored dot in the tab of their web page (maybe not visible on mobile).
'ðŸŸ¢' means they are considered active. 'ðŸŸ¡' means they are considered inactive.
We recommend you put some text in your wait page's ``body_text`` 
to tell participants to be aware of this and stay active on the page.


Notes
~~~~~

If a game has multiple rounds,
you may want to only group by arrival time in round 1:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyWaitPage(WaitPage):
        group_by_arrival_time = True

        @staticmethod
        def is_displayed(player):
            return player.round_number == 1

If you do this, then subsequent rounds will keep the same group structure as
round 1. Otherwise, players will be re-grouped by their arrival time
in each round.
(``group_by_arrival_time`` copies the group structure to future rounds.)

Notes:

-   ``id_in_group`` is not necessarily assigned in the order players arrived at the page.
-   ``group_by_arrival_time`` can only be used if the wait page is the first page in ``page_sequence``
-   If you use ``is_displayed`` on a page with ``group_by_arrival_time``,
    it should only be based on the round number. Don't use ``is_displayed``
    to show the page to some players but not others.
-   If ``group_by_arrival_time = True``, then in ``creating_session``,
    all players will initially be in the same group. Groups are only created
    "on the fly" as players arrive at the wait page.


If you need further control on arranging players into groups,
use :ref:`group_by_arrival_time_method`.

.. _group_by_arrival_time_method:

group_by_arrival_time_method()
------------------------------

If you're using ``group_by_arrival_time`` and want more control over
which players are assigned together, you can also use ``group_by_arrival_time_method()``.

Let's say that in addition to grouping by arrival time, you need each group
to consist of 2 men and 2 women.

If you define a function called ``group_by_arrival_time_method``,
it will get called whenever a new player reaches the wait page.
The function's second argument is the list of players who are currently waiting at your wait page.
If you pick some of these players and return them as a list,
those players will be assigned to a group, and move forward.
If you don't return anything, then no grouping occurs.

Here's an example where each group has 2 men and 2 women.
It assumes that in a previous app, you assigned ``participant.category`` to each participant.

.. code-block:: python

    # note: this function goes at the module level, not inside the WaitPage.
    def group_by_arrival_time_method(subsession, waiting_players):
        print('in group_by_arrival_time_method')
        m_players = [p for p in waiting_players if p.participant.category == 'M']
        f_players = [p for p in waiting_players if p.participant.category == 'F']

        if len(m_players) >= 2 and len(f_players) >= 2:
            print('about to create a group')
            return [m_players[0], m_players[1], f_players[0], f_players[1]]
        print('not enough players yet to create a group')

Timeouts on wait pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use ``group_by_arrival_time_method`` to put a timeout on the wait page,
for example to allow the participant to proceed individually if they have been waiting
longer than 5 minutes. First, you must record ``time.time()`` on the final page before the app with ``group_by_arrival_time``.
Store it in a :ref:`participant field <vars>`.

Then define a Player function:

.. code-block:: python

    def waiting_too_long(player):
        participant = player.participant

        import time
        # assumes you set wait_page_arrival in PARTICIPANT_FIELDS.
        return time.time() - participant.wait_page_arrival > 5*60

Now use this:

.. code-block:: python

    def group_by_arrival_time_method(subsession, waiting_players):
        if len(waiting_players) >= 3:
            return waiting_players[:3]
        for player in waiting_players:
            if waiting_too_long(player):
                # make a single-player group.
                return [player]

This works because the wait page automatically refreshes once or twice a minute,
which re-executes ``group_by_arrival_time_method``.

.. _wait-page-stuck:

Preventing players from getting stuck on wait pages
---------------------------------------------------

A common problem especially with online experiments is players getting stuck
waiting for another player in their group who dropped out or is too slow.

Here are some things you can do to reduce this problem:

Use ``group_by_arrival_time``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described above, you can use ``group_by_arrival_time`` so that only
players who are actively playing around the same time get grouped together.

``group_by_arrival_time`` works well if used after a "lock-in" task.
In other words, before your multiplayer game, you can have a
single-player effort task. The idea is that a
participant takes the effort to complete this initial task, they are
less likely to drop out after that point.

Use page timeouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :ref:`timeout_seconds` on each page, so that if a player is slow or inactive,
their page will automatically advance. Or, you can manually force a timeout by clicking
the "Advance slowest participants" button in the admin interface.

Check timeout_happened
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can tell users they must submit a page before its ``timeout_seconds``,
or else they will be counted as a dropout.
Even have a page that just says "click the next button to confirm you are still playing".
Then check :ref:`timeout_happened`. If it is True, you can do various things such as
set a field on that player/group to indicate the dropout, and skip the rest of the pages in the round.

Replacing dropped out player with a bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example that combines some of the above techniques, so that even if a player drops out,
they continue to auto-play, like a bot.
First, define a :ref:`participant field <PARTICIPANT_FIELDS>` called ``is_dropout``, and set its initial value to
``False`` in ``creating_session``. Then use ``get_timeout_seconds`` and ``before_next_page`` on every page,
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    class Page1(Page):
        form_model = 'player'
        form_fields = ['contribution']

        @staticmethod
        def get_timeout_seconds(player):
            participant = player.participant

            if participant.is_dropout:
                return 1  # instant timeout, 1 second
            else:
                return 5*60

        @staticmethod
        def before_next_page(player, timeout_happened):
            participant = player.participant

            if timeout_happened:
                player.contribution = cu(100)
                participant.is_dropout = True

Notes:

-   If the player fails to submit the page on time, we set ``is_dropout`` to ``True``.
-   Once ``is_dropout`` is set, each page gets auto-submitted instantly.
-   When a page is auto-submitted, you use ``timeout_happened`` to decide what value gets submitted on the user's behalf.


Customizing the wait page's appearance
--------------------------------------

You can customize the text that appears on a wait page
by setting the ``title_text`` and ``body_text`` attributes, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyWaitPage(WaitPage):
        title_text = "Custom title text"
        body_text = "Custom body text"
